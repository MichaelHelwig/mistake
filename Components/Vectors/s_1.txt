E

			... I'm sorry, m'lady... I'm... not sure I... 
E
E
E
				AMIDALA
			No!... No!... No!...
E
E
E
				AMIDALA
			I should not have come back.
E
				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			M'Lady, you are still in danger.
E
E
E
				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			This vote is very important. You did
			your duty and Cord did hers. Now
			come. (she doesn't respond) M'Lady,
			please!
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				MAS AMEDDA
			Order! We shall have order! The motion
			for the Republic to commission an army
			takes precedent, and that is what we
			will vote on at this time.
E
E
E
				PALPATINE
			...My esteemed colleagues, excuse
			me... I have just received some
			tragic and disturbing news. Senator
			Amidala of the Naboo system... Has
			been assassinated!
E
E
E
				PALPATINE
				(continued)
			This grievous blow is especially
			personal to me. Before I became
			Chancellor, I served Amidala when
			she was Queen. She was a great
			leader who fought for justice, not
			only in this honourable assembly,
			but also on her home planet. She
			was so loved she could have been
			elected queen for life. She
			believed in public service, and
			she fervently believed in
			democracy. Her death is a great
			loss to us all. We will all mourn
			her as a relentless champion of
			freedom... and as a dear friend.
E
E
E
				SENATOR ASK AAK
			How many more Senators will die
			before this civil strife ends! We
			must confront these rebels now,
			and they need an army to do it.
E
E
E
E
				AMBASSADOR DARSANA
			Why weren't the Jedi able to stop
			this assassination? We are no
			longer safe, under their protection.
E
E
E
				ORN FREE TAA
			The Republic needs more security
			now! Before it comes to war.
E
				PALPATINE
			Must I remind the Senator from
			Malastare that negotiations are
			continuing with the separatists.
			Peace is our objective here... not
			war.
E
E
E
				AMIDALA
			My noble colleagues, I concur with
			the Supreme Chancellor. At all
			costs, we do not want war!
E
E
E
E
				PALPATINE
			It is with great surprise and
			joy the chair recognises the
			Senator from Naboo, Padm Amidala.
E
				PADM
			Less than an hour ago, an
			assassination attempt was made
			against my life. One of my
			bodyguards and six  others were
			ruthlessly and senselessly
			murdered. I was the target but,
			more importantly, I believe this
			security measure before you, was
			the target. I have led the
			opposition to build an army... but
			there is someone in this body who
			will stop at nothing to assure it's
			passage...
E
E
E
				PADM
			 	(continuing)
			I warn you, if you vote to create
			this army, war will follow. I
			have experienced the misery of war 
			first-hand; I do not wish to do it
			again.
E
E
E
				PADM
			Wake up, Senators... you must wake
			up! If you offer the separatists
			violence, they can only show us
			violence in return! Many will
			lose their lives. All will lose
			their freedom. This decision
			could very well destroy the very
			foundation of our great Republic.
			I pray you do not let fear push
			you into a disastrous decision.
			Vote down this security measure,
			which is nothing less than a
			declaration of war! Does anyone
			here want that? I cannot believe
			they do.
E
E
E
				ORN FREE TAA
			My motion to defer the vote must
			be dealt with first. That is the
			rule of law.
E
E
E
				PALPATINE
			Due to the lateness of the hour
			and the seriousness of this
			motion, we will take up these
			matters tomorrow. Until then, the
			Senate stands adjourned.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				PALPATINE
			I don't know how much longer I can
			hold off the vote, my friends.
			More and more star systems are
			joining the separatists.
E
				MACE WINDU
			If they do break away -
E
				PALPATINE
			No! I will not let that happen!
E
				MACE WINDU
			But if they do, you must realise
			there aren't enough Jedi to
			protect the Republic. We are
			keepers of the peace, not soldiers.
E
				PALPATINE
			Master Yoda, do you think it will
			really come to war?
E
E
E
				YODA
			Worse than war, I fear... Much
			worse. 
E
				PALPATINE
			What?
E
				MACE WINDU
			What do you sense, Master?
E
				YODA
			Impossible to see ... The Dark Side
			clouds everything. But this I am
			sure of -
				(opens his eyes)
			Do their duty the Jedi will.
E
E
E
				DAR WAC
			The loyalist committee has arrived,
			my Lord. 
E
				PALPATINE
			Send them in.
E
E
E
				YODA
			With you the force is strong...
			young Senator. To see you alive
			brings warm feeling to my heart.
E
				PADM
			Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you
			have any idea who was behind
			the attack?
E
				MACE WINDU
			Our intelligence points to
			disgruntled spice miners, on
			the moons of Naboo.
E
				PADM
			I don't wish to disagree but I
			think that Count Dooku was behind
			it.
E
E
E
				MACE WINDU
			You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku
			was once a Jedi. He wouldn't
			assassinate anyone, it is not in
			his character.
E
				KI-ADI-MUNDI
			He is a political idealist, not
			a murderer.
E
				YODA
			In dark times nothing is what it
			appears to be, but the fact remains
			Senator, in grave danger you are.
E
E
E
				PALPATINE
			Count Dooku has always avoided
			any kind of conflict. It appears
			he has no desire to start a war.
			Why would he kill you? To what end?
E
				PADM 
			I don't know, but everything in my
			being tells me he was behind it... 
E
E
E
E
				PALPATINE
			Master Jedi, may I suggest that
			the Senator be placed under the
			protection of your graces.
E
				BAIL ORGANA
			Do you think that is a wise use
			of manpower during these stressful
			times?
E
				PADM
			Chancellor, if I may comment, I
			do not believe the...
E
				PALPATINE
			..."situation is that serious."
			No, but I do, Senator.
E
				PADM
			Chancellor, please! I don't want
			any more guards!
E
				PALPATINE
			I realise all too well that
			additional security might be
			disruptive for you, but perhaps
			someone you are familiar with... an
			old friend like... Master Kenobi...
E
E
E
				MACE WINDU
			That's possible. He has just
			returned from a Border dispute on
			Ansion.
E
				PALPATINE
			You must remember him, M'Lady...
			he watched over you during the
			blockade conflict.
E
				PADM
			This is not necessary, Chancellor.
E
				PALPATINE
			Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I
			will rest easier. We had a big
			scare today. The thought of
			losing you is unbearable.
E
E
E
				MACE WINDU
			I will have Obi-Wan report to you
			immediately, M'Lady.
E
E
E
				YODA
			Too little about yourself you
			worry, Senator, and too much about
			politics. Be mindful of your
			danger, Padm. Accept our help.
E
E
E
				PALPATINE
			I will not like this Republiv, that
			has stood for over a thousand
			years, be split in two
E
E

				JAR JAR
			Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen
			to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo!
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar.
E
				JAR JAR
			Oops! Wheresa mesa manners?
			Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I
			completely forgot myself for
			a moment there. I have had to learn
			Diplodiaclect... speak it like a
			native now. Don't really see the
			point, actually, but members of
			the Senate seem to prefer it...
E
E
E
				JAR JAR
				(continuing)
			...and this, I take it, is your
			apprentice... Nooooooooo! Annie?
			Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie?
				(Looks at Anakin)
			Nooooooo! Yousa so biggen!
			Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no

E
				ANAKIN
			Hi, Jar Jar.
E
E
E
				JAR JAR
			Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii!
E
E
E
E
				JAR JAR
			Lookie... lookie... Oops!... Oh,
			dear, I'm afraid I've forgotten
			myself again.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			It's a great pleasure to see you again,
			M'Lady.
E
				PADM
			It has been far too long Master
			Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths
			have crossed again... but I must
			warn you that I think your
			presence here is unnecessary.
E
				OBI-WAN
			I'm sure the Jedi Council have
			their reasons.
E
E
E
				PADM
			Annie??
				(stares)
			My goodness you've grown.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
				(trying to be smooth)
			So have you... grown more
			beautiful, I mean... and much
			shorter... for a Senator, I mean.
E
E
E
				PADM
			Oh Annie, you'll always be that
			little boy I knew on Tatooine.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			Our presence will be invisible,
			M'Lady.
E
				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			I am very grateful you are here,
			Master Kenobi. The situation is
			more dangerous than the Senator
			will admit.
E
				PADM
			I don't need more security, I need
			answers. I want to know who is
			trying to kill me.
E
				OBI-WAN
				(frowning)
			We're here to protect you
			Senator, not to start an
			investigation.
E
				ANAKIN
			We will find out who is trying to
			kill you Padm, I promise you.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			We are not going to exceed our
			mandate, my young Padawan learner.
E
				ANAKIN
			I meant in the interest of
			protecting her, Master, of course.
E
				OBI-WAN
			We are not going through this
			exercise again, Anakin. You will
			pay attention to my lead.
E
				ANAKIN
			Why?
E
				OBI-WAN
			What??!!
E
				ANAKIN
			Why else do you think we were
			assigned to her, if not to find
			the killer? Protection is a job
			for local security... not Jedi.
			It's overkill, Master.
			Investigation is implied in our
			mandate.
E
				OBI-WAN
			We will do as the Council has
			instructed, and you will learn
			your place, young one.
E
				PADM
			Perhaps with merely your presence,
			the mysteries surrounding this
			threat will be revealed.  Now if
			you will excuse me I will retire.
E
E
E
				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			Well, I know I feel a lot better
			having you here.
			I'll have an officer on every
			floor and I'll be at the command
			centre downstairs.
E
				JAR JAR 
			Mesa busten wit happiness seein
			Yousa again, Annie. Deesa bad
			times, bombad times.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			She didn't even recognise me, Jar
			Jar. I thought about her every
			day since we parted... and she's
			forgotten me completely.
E
				JAR JAR
			Shesa happy. Happier den mesa
			see-en her in longo time.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Anakin, you're focusing on the
			Negative again. Be mindful of your
			thoughts. She was glad to see us.
			Now lets check the security here.
E
				ANAKIN
			Yes, my master.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				MACE WINDU
			Why couldn't we see this attack on
			the Senator?
E
				YODA
			Masking the future, is this
			disturbance in the Force.
E
				MACE WINDU
			The propecy is coming true, the
			Dark Side is growing.
E
				YODA
			And only those who have turned to
			the Dark Side can sense the
			possibilities of the future. Only
			going through the Dark Side can we
			see.
E
				MACE WINDU
			It's been ten years, and the Sith
			still have no shown themselves.
			Do you think they are behind this?
E
				YODA
			...Out there, they are. A
			certainty that is.
E
				MACE WINDU
			Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice
			will be able to bring balance to
			the Force?
E
				YODA
			Only if he chooses to follow his
			destiny.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			Captain Typho has more than enough
			men downstairs. No assassin will
			try that way. Any activity up
			here?
E
				ANAKIN
			Quiet as a tomb. I don't like
			just waiting here for something to
			happen to her.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			What's going on?
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			She covered that camera. I don't
			think she liked me watching her.
E
				OBI-WAN
			What is she thinking?
E
				ANAKIN
			She programmed Artoo to warn us if
			there's an intruder.
E
				OBI-WAN
			It's not an intruder I'm worried
			about. There are many other ways
			to kill a Senator.
E
				ANAKIN
			I know, but we also want to catch
			this assassin. Don't we, Master?
E
				OBI-WAN
			You're using her as bait??
E
				ANAKIN
			It was her idea... No harm will
			come to her. I can sense
			everything going on in that room.
			Trust me.
E
				OBI-WAN
			It's too risky... and your senses
			aren't that attuned, young
			apprentice.
E
				ANAKIN
			And yours are?
E
				OBI-WAN
			Possibly.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN 
			You look tired.
E
				ANAKIN
			I don't sleep well, anymore.
E
				OBI-WAN 
			Because of your mother?
E
				ANAKIN
			I don't know why I keep dreaming
			About her now. I haven't seen her
			since I was little.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Dreams pass in time.
E
				ANAKIN
			I'd rather dream of Padm. Just
			Being around her again is...
			intoxicating.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they
			betray you. You've made a
			commitment to the Jedi order... a
			commitment not easily broken...
			and don't forget she's a
			politician. They're not to be
			trusted.
E
				ANAKIN 
			She's not like the others in the
			Senate, Master.
E
				OBI-WAN
			It's been my experience that
			Senators are only focused on
			pleasing those who fund their
			campaigns... and they are more
			than willing to forget the
			niceties of democracy to get those
			funds.
E
				ANAKIN
			Not another lecture, Master. Not
			on the economics of politics....
			It's too early in the morning... and
			besides, you're generalising. The
			Chancellor doesn't appear to
			be corrupt.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Palpatine's a politician, I've
			observed that he is very clever at
			following the passions and
			prejudices of the Senators.
E
				ANAKIN
			I think he is a good man. My
			instincts are very positive
			about...
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			I sense it, too.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			Stay here!
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			I have a bad feeling about this.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			That was wacky! I almost lost you
			in the traffic.
E
				OBI-WAN
			What took you so long?
E
				ANAKIN
			Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't
			find a speeder I really liked,
			with an open cockpit... and with
			the right speed capabilities...
			and then you know I had to get a
			really gonzo color...
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			If you'd spend as much time
			working on your saber skills as
			you do on your wit, young Padawan,
			you would rival Master Yoda as a
			swordsman.
E
				ANAKIN
			I thought I already did.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Only in your mind, my very young
			apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			Sorry, I forgot you don't like
			flying, Master.
E
				OBI-WAN
			I don't mind flying... but
			what you're doing is suicide!
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			Master, you know I've been flying
			since before I could walk. I'm very
			good at this.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Just slow down!
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Wait! Don't go in there!
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			You know I don't like it when you
			do that!
E
				ANAKIN
			Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this
			guy's gonna kill himself any
			minute now!
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			What are you doing? He's gonna
			blast me!
E
				ANAKIN
			Right - this isn't working.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			That was too close!
E
				ANAKIN
			Clear that!
E
				OBI-WAN
			What??
E
				ANAKIN
			Clear the flag! We're losing
			power! Hurry!
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I
			don't  like it when you do that!
E
				ANAKIN
			So sorry, Master.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			It's dangerous near those power
			couplings! Slow down! Don't go
			through there!
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Yiiii, what are you doing?
E
				ANAKIN
			Sorry, Master!
E
				OBI-WAN
				(sarcastically)
			Oh, that was good...
E
				ANAKIN
			That was crazy!!!
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Ahh, damn.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Stop!!
E
				ANAKIN
			No, we can make it.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm
			crazy.
E
				ANAKIN
			But it worked... we made it.
E
				OBI-WAN
				(angrily)
			It didn't work... we've stalled!
			And you almost got us killed!
E
				ANAKIN
			I think we're still alive.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
				(very angrily)
			It was stupid!
E
				ANAKIN
				(sheepishly)
			I could have made it...
E
				OBI-WAN
				(furious)
			But you didn't!!! And now we've
			lost him.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			No we didnt...
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			Where are you going?! He went
			down there, the other way.
E
				ANAKIN
			This is a shortcut... I think.
E
				OBI-WAN
			What do you mean, You think?
			What kind of shortcut?! He went
			completely the other way! Youve
			lost him!
E
				ANAKIN
			Master, if we keep this chase
			going, that creeps gonna end up
			deep fried. Personally, Id very
			much like to find out who in the
			hell he is and who hes working
			for...
E
				OBI-WAN
				(sarcastic)
			Oh, so thats why were going in
			the wrong direction.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Well, you lost him.
E
				ANAKIN
			Im deeply sorry, Master.
E
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Excuse me for a moment.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			Anakin!
E
				ANAKIN
			She went into that club, Master.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Patience.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			 	(continuing)
			Here. Next time try not to lose it.
E
				ANAKIN
			Sorry, Master.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			A Jedi's saber is his most
			precious possession.
E
				ANAKIN
			Yes, Master.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			He must keep it with him at all
			times.
E
				ANAKIN
			I know, Master.
E
				OBI-WAN
			This weapon is your life!
E
				ANAKIN
			I've heard this lesson before...
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			But, you haven't learned anything,
			Anakin.
E
				ANAKIN
			I try, Master.
E
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			Why do I think you are going to be
			the death of me?!
E
				ANAKIN
			Don't say that Master... You're
			the closest thing I have to a
			father... I love you. I don't want
			to cause you pain.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Then why don't you listen to me?!
E
				ANAKIN
			I will. I'll do better, I promise.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Do you see him him?
E
				ANAKIN
			I think he's a she...
E
				OBI-WAN
			Then be extra careful...
				(nods to a room)
			Check it out.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			Where are you going, Master?
E
				OBI-WAN
			To get a drink.
E
E
E
E
E
				ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO
			Wanna buy some death sticks?
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			You don't want to sell me death-
			sticks.
E
				ELAN
			I don't want to sell you death-
			sticks.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			You want to go home and rethink 
			your life.
E
				ELAN
			I want to go home and rethink my
			life.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			Easy... Official business. Go
			back to your drinks.
E
E
E
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			Do you know who it was you were
			trying to kill?
E
				ZAM WESSEL
			The Senator from Naboo.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Who hired you?
E
E
E
				ZAM WESSEL
			It was just a job.
E
				ANAKIN
			Tell us!
E
				ZAM WESSEL
			That Senator's gonna die soon
			anyway, and the next one won't
			make the same mistake I did...
E
				OBI-WAN
			This wound's going to need
			treatment.
E
				ANAKIN
			Who hired you? Tell us... tell us
			now!
E
E
E
				ZAM
			It was a Bounty Hunter called...
E
E
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			Toxic Dart...
E
E
E
E
E
				PADM
			Representative Binks. I know I can
			count on you.
E
				JAR JAR
			Yousa betchen mesa bottums.
E
				PADM
			What?!
E
				JAR JAR
				(coughs, recovers)
			Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean,
			I am honoured to accept this heavy
			burden. I take on this
			responsibility with deep humility
			tinged with an overwhelming pride.
				(pompously)
			It is not every day that I am
			called upon to...
E
E
E
				PADM
			You're a good friend, Jar Jar. I
			don't wish to hold you up. I'm
			sure you have a great deal to do.
E
				JAR JAR
			Of course, M'lady.
E
E
E
				PADM
			I do not like this idea of hiding.
E
				ANAKIN
			Don't worry. Now that the Council
			has ordered an investigation, it
			won't take Master Obi-Wan long to
			find that bounty hunter.
E
				PADM
				(frustrated)
			I haven't worked for a year to
			defeat the "Military Creation Act"
			not to be here when its fate is
			decided.
E
				ANAKIN
			Sometimes we have to let go of our
			pride and do what is requested of
			us.
E
				PADM
			Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and
			you don't have a very firm grip on
			politics. I suggest you reserve
			your opinions for some other time.
E
				ANAKIN
			Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying
			to...
E
				PADM
			Annie! No!
E
				ANAKIN
			Please don't call me that.
E
				PADM
			What?
E
				ANAKIN
			Annie...
E
				PADM
			I've always called you that... it
			is your name, isn't it?
E
				ANAKIN
			It's Anakin. When you say Annie
			it's like I'm still a little
			boy... and I'm not.
E
				PADM
			I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible
			to deny you've...
				(looks him over)
			...that you've grown up.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			Master Obi-Wan manages not to see
			it...
E
				PADM
			Mentors have a way of seeing more
			of our faults than we would like.
			It's the only way we grow.
E
				ANAKIN
			Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is
			a great mentor. As wise as Master
			Yoda and as powerful as Master
			Windu. I am truly thankful to be
			his apprentice. Only... although
			I'm a Padawan learner, in some
			ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead
			of him. I'm ready for the trials.
			I know I am! He knows it too. He
			believes I'm too unpredictable...
			Other Jedi my age have gone
			through the trials and made it...
			I know I started my training
			late... but he won't let me move
			on.
E
				PADM
			That must be frustrating.
E
				ANAKIN
			It's worse... he's overly
			critical. He never listens! He
			just doesn't understand! It's not
			fair!
E
E
E
				PADM
			I'm sorry... You sounded exactly
			like that little boy I once knew,
			when he didn't get his way.
E
				ANAKIN
			I'm not whining! I'm not.
E
E
E
				PADM
			I didn't say it to hurt you.
E
				ANAKIN
			I know...
E
E
E
				PADME
			Anakin...
E
E
E
				PADM
				(continuing)
			Don't try to grow up too fast.
E
				ANAKIN
			I am grown up. You said it
			yourself.
E
E
E
				PADM
			Please don't look at me like that.
E
				ANAKIN
			Why not?
E
				PADM
			Because I can see what you're
			thinking.
E
				ANAKIN
				(laughing)
			Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers
			too?
E
E
E
				PADM
			It makes me feel uncomfortable.
E
				ANAKIN
			Sorry, M'lady.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			Be safe, m'lady.
E
				PADM
			Thank you, Captain. Take good
			care of Dorme... the threat's on
			you two now.
E
				DORME
			He'll be safe with me.
E
E
E
				PADM
			You'll be fine.
E
				DORME
			It's not me, M'Lady. I worry
			about you. What if they realise
			I'm not you?
E
				PADM
				(looks to Anakin)
			Then my Jedi protector will have
			to prove how grown up he is.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			Anakin, you stay put on Naboo.
			Do not attract any attention. Do
			absolutely nothing without
			checking in with me or the Council.
E
				ANAKIN
			Yes, Master.
E
				OBI-WAN
				(to Padme)
			I will get to the bottom of this
			plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be
			back here in no time.
E
				PADM
			I will be most grateful for your
			speed, Master Jedi.
E
				ANAKIN
			Time to go.
E
				PADM
			I know. 
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			May the Force be with you.
E
				ANAKIN
			May the Force be with you, Master.
E
E
E
				PADM
			Suddenly, I'm afraid...
E
				ANAKIN
			I'm kinda scared too. This is my
			first assignment on my own.
E
				PADM
			There's nothing to worry about...
			we have Artoo with us.
E
E
E
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			I hope he doesn't try anything
			foolish.
E
				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			I'd be more concerned about her
			doing something, than him.
E
E
E

E
E
E
E
				PK-4
			Place the subject for analysis on
			the sensot tray, please.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			It's a toxic dart. I need to know
			where it came from and who made it.
E
				PK-4
			One moment, please.
E
E
E
				PK-4
				(continuing)
			As you can see on your screen,
			subject weapon does not exist in
			any known culture. Markings
			cannot be identified. Probablt
			self-made by a warrior not

E
				OBI-WAN
			Excuse me? Could you try again
			please?
E
				PK-4
			Master Jedi, our records are very
			thorough. they cover eight
			percent of the galaxy. If I can't
			tell you where it came from,
			nobody can.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			Thanks for your assistance! You
			may not be able to figure this
			out, but I think I know someone
			who might.
E

			Keep moving! Keep moving!
E
E
E

				(continuing)
			Hey! No Droids!
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			No, no, Mom, no...
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			What?
E
				PADM
			You seemed to be having a
			nightmare.
E
E
E
				PADM
				(continuing)
			Are you hungry?
E
				ANAKIN
			Thank you.
E
				PADM
			We went into lightspeed a while
			ago.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			I look forward to seeing Naboo
			again. I've thought about it every
			day since I left. It's by far the
			most beautiful place I've ever
			seen...
E
E
E
				PADM
			You were just a little boy then.
			It may not be as you remember it;
			time changes your perception.
E
				ANAKIN
			I think time has given me much
			more mature feelings to enhance my
			perception.
E
				PADM
			It must be difficult having sworn
			your life to the Jedi... not being
			able to visit the places you
			like... or do the things you
			like...
E
				ANAKIN
			Or be with the people I love.
E
				PADM
			Are you allowed to love? I
			thought that was forbidden for a
			Jedi.
E
				ANAKIN
			Attachment is forbidden.
			Possession is forbidden.
			Compassion, which I would define
			as unconditional love, is central
			to a Jedi's life, so you might say
			we're encouraged to love.
E
				PADM
			You have changed so much
E
				ANAKIN
			You haven't changed a bit. You're
			exactly the way I remember you in
			my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has
			changed much either.
E
				PADM
			It hasn't...
E
				ANAKIN
			I can't wait to breathe the sweet
			breeze that comes off the rolling
			hills. Whenever I try to
			visualise the Force, those hills
			are what I see.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			I love Naboo.
E
E
E
				PADM
				(changing the subject)
			Were you dreaming about you
			mother earlier, weren't you?
E
				ANAKIN
			Yes... I left Tatooine so long
			ago, my memory of her is fading.
			I don't want to lose it. Recently
			I've been seeing her in my
			dreams... vivid dreams... scary
			dreams. I worry about her.
E
E
E
E
E
E

E
E
				HERMIONE
			Can I help ya?
E
				OBI-WAN
			I'm looking for Dexter.
E
E
E
				HERMIONE BAGWA
			Waddya want him for?
E
				OBI-WAN
			He's not in trouble. It's
			personal.
E
E
E
				HERMIONE BAGWA
			Someone to see ya, honey
				(lowering her voice)
			A Jedi, by the looks of him.
E
E
E

			Obi-Wan!
E
				OBI-WAN
			Hey, Dex.
E
				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Take a seat! Be right with ya!
E
E
E
				HERMIONE BAGWA
			You want a cup of ardees?
E
				OBI-WAN
			Thank you.
E
E
E
				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Hey, ol' buddy!
E
				OBI-WAN
			Hey, Dex.
E
E
E
				DEXTER JETTSTER
			So, my friend. What can I do for
			ya?
E
				OBI-WAN
			You can tell me what this is.
E
E
E
				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Well, whattaya know...
E
E
E
				DEXTER JETTSTER
				(continuing)
			I ain't seen one of these since I
			was prospecting on Subterrel
			beyond the Outer Rim!
E
				OBI-WAN
			Do you know where it came from?
E
E
E
				DEXTER JETTSTER
			This baby belongs to them cloners.
			What you got here is a Kamino
			Kyberdart.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Kamino Kyberdart... I wonder why
			it didn't show up in any analysis
			archive.
E
				DEXTER JETTSTER
			It's these funny little cuts on
			the side give it away...
			Those analysis droids you've got
			over there only focus on symbols,
			you know. I should think you Jedi
			would have more respect for the
			difference between knowledge and
			wisdom.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Well, Dex, if droids could think, we
			wouldn't be here, would we?
				(laughing)
			Kamino... doesn't sound familiar.
			Is it part of the Republic?
E
				DEXTER JETTSTER
			No, it's beyond the Outer Rim.
			I'd say about twelve parsecs
			outside the Rishi Maze, toward the
			south. It should be easy to find,
			even for those droids in your
			archive to find. Those Kaminoans
			keep to themselves. They're
			cloners. Damned good ones, too.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			Cloners? Are they friendly?
E
				DEXTER JETTSTER
			It depends.
E
				OBI-WAN
			On what, Dex?
E
E
E
				DEXTER JETTSTER
			On how good your manners are...
			and how big your pocketbook is...
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			If I grew up here, I don't think
			I'd ever leave.
E
				PADM
				(laughing)
			I doubt that.
E
				ANAKIN
			No, really. When I started my
			training, I was very homesick and
			very lonely. This city and my Mom
			were the only pleasant things I
			had to think about... The problem
			was, the more I thought about my
			Mom, the worse I felt. But I
			would feel better if I thought
			about the palace - the way it
			shimmers in the sunlight - the way
			the air always smells of flowers...
E
				PADM
			...and the soft sound of the
			distant waterfalls. The first
			time I saw the Capital, I was very
			young... I'd never seen a
			waterfall before. I though they
			were so beautiful... I never
			dreamed one day I'd live in the
			palace.
E
				ANAKIN
			Well, tell me, did you dream of
			power and politics when you were
			a little girl?
E
				PADM
				(laughing)
			No! That was the last thing I
			thought of. My dream was to help
			in the "Refugee Relief Movement."
			I never thought of running for
			elected office. But the more
			history I studied, the more I
			realised how much good politicians
			could do. So when I was eight, I
			joined the "Apprentice
			Legislators", then later on became
			a Senatorial advisor, with such a
			passion that, before I knew it, I
			was elected Queen. Partly because
			I scored so high on my education
			certificate, but for the most part
			it was my conviction that reform
			was possible. I wasn't the
			youngest Queen ever elected, but
			now that I think back on it, I'm
			not sure I was old enough. I'm not
			sure I was ready.
E
				ANAKIN
			The people you served thought you
			did a good job. I heard they
			tried to amend the Constitution so
			you could stay in office.
E
				PADM
			Popular rule is not democracy,
			Annie. It gives the people what
			they want, not what they need.
			And, truthfully, I was relieved
			when my two terms were up. So
			were my parents. They worried
			About me during the blockade and
			couldn't wait for it all to be
			over. Actually, I was hoping to
			have a family by now... My
			sisters have the most amazing,
			wonderful kids... but when the
			Queen asked me to serve as
			Senator, I couldn't refuse her.
E
				ANAKIN
			I agree! I think the Republic
			needs you... I'm glad you chose
			to serve. I feel things are going
			to happen in our generation that
			will change the galaxy in profound
			ways.
E
				PADM
			I think so too.
E
E
E
E
E
E
				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			We've been worried about you.
				(takes her hand)
			I'm so glad you're safe, Padm.
E
				PADM
			Thank you, Your Highness. I only
			Wish I could have served you
			better by staying on Coruscant for
			the vote.
E
				SIO BIBBLE
			Given the circumstances, Senator,
			you know it was the only decision
			Her Highness could have made.
E
				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			How many systems have joined Count
			Dooku and the separatists?
E
				PADM
			About two hundred. And more are
			leaving the Republic every day.
			If the Senate votes to create an
			army, I'm sure it's going to push
			us into a civil war.
E
				SIO BIBBLE
			It's unthinkable! There hasn't
			been a full-scale war since the
			formation of the Republic!
E
				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			Do you see any way, through
			negotiations, to bring the
			separatists back into the Republic?
E
				PADM
			Not if they feel threatened. The
			separatists don't have an army,
			but if they are provoked, they
			will move to defend themselves.
			I'm sure of that. And with no time
			or money to build an army, my
			guess is they will turn to the
			Commerce Guilds or the Trade
			Federation for help.
E
				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			The armies of commerce! Why has
			Nothing been done in the Senate
			to restrain them?
E
				PADM
			I'm afraid that, despite the
			Chancellor's best efforts, there
			are still many bureaucrats,
			judges, and even Senators on the
			payrolls of the Guilds.
E
				SIO BIBBLE
			It's outrageous! After all of
			those hearings, and the four trials in
			the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is
			still the Viceroy of the Trade
			Federation. Do those money
			mongers control everything?
E
				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			Remember, Counsellor, the courts
			were able to reduce the
			Federation's armies. That's a
			move in the right
			direction.
E
				PADM
			There are rumours, Your Highness,
			that the Federation Army was not
			reduced as they were ordered.
E
				ANAKIN
			The Jedi have not been allowed to
			investigate. It would be to be too
			dangerous for the economy, we were
			told.
E
				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			We must keep our faith in the
			Republic. The day we stop
			believing democracy can work is
			the day we lose it.
E
				PADM
			Let's pray that day never comes.
E
				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			In the meantime, we must consider
			your own safety.
E
E
E
				SIO BIBBLE
				(to Anakin)
			What is your suggestion, Master
			Jedi?
E
				PADM
			Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor.
			He's still a Padawan learner. I
			was thinking...
E
				ANAKIN
				(nettled)
			Hey, hold on a minute!
E
				PADM
			Excuse me! I was thinking I would
			stay in the Lake Country. There
			are some places up there that are
			very isolated.
E
				ANAKIN
			Excuse me?! I am in charge of
			security here, M'Lady.
E
E
E
				PADM
			Annie, my life is at risk, and
			this is my home. I know it very
			well... that is why we're here.
			I think it would be wise for you
			to take advantage of my knowledge
			in this instance.
E
				ANAKIN
				(takes a deep breath)
			Sorry, M'Lady.
E
				SIO BIBBLE
				(to Anakin, amused)
			She is right. The Lake Country is
			the most remote part of Naboo.
			Not many people and a clear view
			of the surrounding terrain.
E
				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			Perfect. It's settled then.
E
E
E
				QUEEN JAMILLIA
				(continued)
			Padm, I had an audience with your
			father yesterday. I told him what
			was happening. He hopes you will
			visit your mother before you
			leave... your family's very
			worried about you.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				JOCASTA NU
			Did you call for assistance?
E
				OBI-WAN
				(distracted in thought)
			Yes... yes, I did...
E
				JOCASTA NU
			He has a powerful face, doesn't
			he? He was one of the most
			brilliant Jedi I have had the
			privilege of knowing.
E
				OBI-WAN
			I never understood why he quit.
			Only twenty Jedi have ever left
			the Order.
E
				JOCASTA NU
				(sighs)
			The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku
			was the most recent and the most
			painful. No one likes to talk
			about it. His leaving was a great
			loss to the Order.
E
				OBI-WAN
			What happened?
E
				JOCASTA NU
			Well, one might say, he was always
			a bit out of step with the
			decisions of the Council... much
			like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
E
				OBI-WAN
				(surprised)
			Really?
E
				JOCASTA NU
			Oh, yes. They were alike in many
			ways. Very individual thinkers...
			idealists...
E
E
E
				JOCASTA NU
				(continuing
			He was always striving to become
			a more powerful Jedi. He wanted
			to be the best. With a lightsaber,
			in the old style of fencing, he
			had no match. His knowledge of
			the Force was... unique. In the
			end, I think he left because he
			lost faith in the Republic. He
			believed that politics were
			corrupt, and he felt the Jedi
			betrayed themselves by serving the
			politicians. He always had very
			high expectations of government.
			He disappeared for nine or ten
			years, then he just showed up
			recently as the head of the
			separatist movement.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Interesting... I'm still not sure
			I understand.
E
				JOCASTA NU
			Well, I'm sure you didn't call me
			over here for a history lesson.
			Are you having a problem, Master
			Kenobi?
E
				OBI-WAN
			Yes, I'm trying to find a planet
			system called Kamino. It doesn't
			seem to show upon any of the
			archive charts.
E
				JOCASTA NU
			Kamino? It's not a system I'M
			familiar with... Let me see...
E
E
E
				JOCASTA NU
				(continuing)
			Are you sure you have the right
			co-ordinates?
E
				OBI-WAN
				(nodding)
			According to my information, it
			should be in this quadrant
			somewhere... just south of the
			Rishi Maze.
E
E
E
				JOCASTA NU
			No co-ordinates? It sounds like the
			kind of directions you'd get from
			a street tout... some old miner or
			Furbog trader.
E
				OBI-WAN
			All three actually.
E
				JOCASTA NU
			Are you sure it exists?
E
				OBI-WAN
			Absolutely.
E
				JOCASTA NU
			Let me do a gravitational scan.
E
E
E
				JOCASTA NU
			There are some inconsistencies
			here. Maybe the planet you're
			looking for was destroyed.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Wouldn't that be on record?
E
				JOCASTA NU
			It ought to be. Unless it was very
			recent.
				(shakes her head)
			I hate to say it, but it looks
			like the system you're searching
			for doesn't exist.
E
				OBI-WAN
			That's impossible... perhaps the
			archives are incomplete.
E
				JOCASTA NU
			The archives are comprehensive and
			totally secure, my young Jedi.
			One thing you may be absolutely
			sure of - if an item does not
			appear in our records, it does not
			exist!
E
E
E
E
E
E
				PADME
			There's my house!
E
E
E
				PADME
				(continuing)
			What? Don't say you're shy!
E
				ANAKIN
				(untruthfully)
			No, but I...
E
E
E
				RYOO & POOJA
			Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!
E
				PADME
			Ryoo!! Pooja!!
E
E
E
				PADME
				(continuing)
			I'm so happy to see you! This is
			Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and
			this is Pooja.
E
E
E
				RYOO & POOJA
			Artoo!!!
E
E
E
E
E
E
				SOLA
				(over her shoulder)
			They're eating over at Jev
			Narran's later, Mom. They just
			had a snack. They'll be fine.
E
E
E
				PADME
			Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.
E
				SOLA
			Hello, Anakin.
E
				ANAKIN
			Hello.
E
E
E
				JOBAL
			You're just in time for dinner. I
			hope you're hungry, Anakin.
E
				ANAKIN
			A little.
E
				PADME
			He's being polite, Mom. We're
			starving.
E
				RUWEE
				(grinning)
			You came to the right place at the
			right time. Sit down, son.
E
E
E
				JOBAL
				(to Padme)
			Honey, it's so good to see you
			safe. We were so worried.
E
E
E
				RUWEE
			Dear...
E
				JOBAL
			I know, I know... but I had to say
			it. Now it's done.
E
				SOLA
			Well, this is exciting! Do you
			know, Anakin, you're the first
			boyfriend my sister's ever brought
			home?
E
				PADME
				(rolls her eyes)
			Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend!
			He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate
			to protect me.
E
				JOVAL
			A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They
			didn't tell us it was that serious!
E
				PADME
			It's not, Mom, I promise.
				(glances at Jobal)
			Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've
			known him for years. Remember
			that little boy who was with the
			Jedi during the blockade crisis?
E
E
E
				PADME
				(continuing)
			He grew up.
E
				JOBAL
			Honey, when are you going to
			settle down? Haven't you had
			enough of that life? I certainly
			have!
E
				PADME
			Mom, I'm not in any danger.
E
				RUWEE
				(to Anakin)
			Is she?
E
				ANAKIN
			...Yes... I'm afraid she is.
E
				PADME
				(quickly)
			But not much.
E
E
E
E
				RUWEE
			Sometimes I wish I'd traveled
			more... but I must say, I'm happy
			here.
E
				ANAKIN
			Padme tells me you teach at the
			university?
E
				RUWEE
				(nodding)
			Yes, and before that, I was a
			builder. I also worked for the
			Refugee Relief Movement, when I
			was very young.
E
E
E
E
				SOLA
			Why haven't you told us about him?
E
				PADM
			What's there to talk about?  He's
			just a boy.
E
				SOLA
			A boy? Have you seen the way he
			looks at you?
E
				PADM
			Sola - stop it!
E
				SOLA
			It's obvious he has feelings for
			you. Are you saying, little baby
			sister, that you haven't noticed?
E
				PADM
			I'm not your baby sister, Sola.
			Anakin and I are friends... our
			relationship is strictly
			professional.
				(to Jobal)
			Mom, would you tell her to stop it?
E
				SOLA
				(laughing)
			Well, maybe you haven't noticed
			the way he looks at you. I think
			you're afraid to.
E
				PADM
			Cut it out.
E
				JOBAL
			Sola's just concerned... we all
			are.
E
				PADM
			Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What
			I'm doing is important.
E
				JOBAL
			You've done your service, Padm.
			It's time you had a life of your
			own. You're missing so much!
E
E
E
E
				RUWEE
			Now tell me, son. How serious is
			this thing? How much danger is my
			daughter really in?
E
				ANAKIN
			There have been two attempts on
			her life. Chances are there'll be
			more. My Master is tracking down
			the assassins. I'm sure he'll find
			out who they are. This situation,
			won't last long.
E
				RUWEE
			I don't want anything to happen to
			her.
E
				ANAKIN
			I don't either.
E
E
E
E
				PADME
			Don't worry, this won't take long.
E
				ANAKIN
			I just want to get there before
			dark.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			You still live at home.
E
				PADME
			I move around so much, I've never
			had a place of my own. Official
			residences have no warmth. I feel
			good here. I feel at home.
E
				ANAKIN
			I never had a real home. Home was
			always where my Mom was.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Is this you?
E
E
E
				PADME
			That was when I went with the
			Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran.
			Their sun was imploding, and the
			planet was dying. I was helping
			to relocate the children. See
			that little one I'm holding? His
			name was N'a-kee-tula, which means
			sweethear. He was so full of 
			life,. All those kids were. I did
			everything I could to save him,
			but he died... they all did. They
			were never able to adapt... to
			live off their native planet.
E
E
E
				PADME
				(continuing)
			My first day as an Apprentice
			Legislator. Notice the difference?
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				YODA
			Don't think... feel... be as one
			with the Force. Help you, it will.
				(he sees Obi-Wan)
			Younglings - enough! A visitor we
			have. Welcome him.
E
E
E
				YODA
				(continuing)
			Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the
			mighty Bear Clan.
E
				CHILDREN
			Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!
E
				OBI-WAN
			I am sorry to disturb you, Master.
E
				YODA
			What help to you, can I be?
E
				OBI-WAN
			Im looking for a planet described
			to me by an old friend. I trust
			him. But the system doesnt show
			up on the archive maps.
E
				YODA
			An interesting puzzle. Gather
			round the map reader, younglings.
			Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet.
			Find it, we will try...
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			This is where it ought to be...
			but it isnt. Gravity is pulling
			all the stars in this area inward
			to this spot. There should be a
			star here... but there isnt.
E
				YODA
			Most interesting. Gravitys
			silhouette remains, but the star
			and all its planets have
			disappeared. How can this be?
E
E
E
				JEDI CHILD JACK
			Because someone erased it from the
			archive memory.
E
				CHILDREN
			Thats right! Yes! Thats what
			happened! Someone erased it!
E
				JEDI CHILD MAY
			If the planet blew up, the gravity
			would go away.
E
E
E
				YODA
			Truly wonderful, the mind of a
			child is. Uncluttered. To the
			centre of the pull of gravity go,
			and find your planet you will.
E
				OBI-WAN
			But Master Yoda who could have
			erased information from the
			archives? Thats impossible,
			isnt it?
E
				YODA
				(frowning)
			Much harder to answer, that
			question is.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				PADM
			When I was in Level Three, we used
			to come here for school retreat.
			See that island? We used to swim
			there every day. I love the water.
E
				ANAKIN
			I do too. I guess it comes from
			growing up on a desert planet.
E
E
E
				PADM
			...We used to lie on the sand and
			let the sun dry us... and try to
			guess the names of the birds
			singing.
E
				ANAKIN
			I dont like sand. Its coarse
			and rough and irritating, and it
			gets everywhere. Not like here.
			Here everythings soft... and
			smooth...
E
E
E
				PADM
			There was a very old man who lived
			on the island. He used to make
			glass out of sand - and vases and
			necklaces out of the glass. They
			were magical.
E
				ANAKIN
				(looks into her eyes)
			Everything here is magical.
E
				PADM
			You could look into the glass and
			see the water. The way it ripples
			and moves. It looked so real...
			but it wasnt.
E
				ANAKIN
			Sometimes, when you believe
			something to be real, it becomes
			real. Real enough, anyway...
E
E
E
				PADM
			I used to think if you looked too
			deeply into glass, you would
			lose yourself.
E
				ANAKIN
			I think it's true...
E
E
E
				PADM
			I shouldn't have done that.
E
				ANAKIN
			I'm sorry. When I'm around you,
			my mind is no longer my own.
E
				PADM
			It's the situation... the stress...
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			...the view.
E
E
E
E
				MACE WINDU
			Be wary, this disturbance in the
			Force is growing stronger.
E
				OBI-WAN
			I am concerned for my Padawan. He
			is not ready to be on his own.
E
				YODA
			The Council is confident in this decision,
			Obi-Wan.
E
				MACE
			He has exceptional skills. The
			Council is confident in its
			decision, Obi-Wan. If the
			prophecy is true, he weill be the
			one to bring balance to the Force.
E
				OBI-WAN
			But he still has much to learn.
			And his abilities have made him...
			well... arrogant. I realise now
			what you and Master Yoda knew from
			the beginning... the boy was too
			old to start the training and...
E
E
E
				MACE WINDU
			There's something else?
E
				OBI-WAN
			Master, he should not have been
			given this assignment. I'm afraid
			Anakin won't be able to protect
			the Senator. 
E
				MACE WINDU
			Why?
E
				OBI-WAN
			He has a... an emotional
			connection with her. It's been
			there since he was boy. Now
			he's confused... distracted.
E
				MACE-WINDU
			Obi-Wan, you must have faith that
			he will take the right path.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			Has Master Yoda gained any insight
			into whether or not this war will
			come about?
E
				MACE WINDU
			Probing the Dark Side is a
			dangerous process. He could be in
			seclusion for days... May the
			force be with you.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				PADME
			You did that?
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			What?
E
E
E
				PADME
			That! Now stop it!
E
E
E
				PADME
				(continuing)
			Anakin!!
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			I'm not really supposed to do
			that... for fun, I mean. If
			Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be
			very grumpy.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			May I tell you something?
E
				PADME
			I don't know.
E
				ANAKIN
			Then how can I tell you?
E
				PADME
			Maybe you should use your Jedi
			intuition.
E
				ANAKIN
			It doesn't work around you. My
			mind is always a muddle... I can
			only think of you.
E
				PADME
			Anakin, don't...
E
				ANAKIN
			From the moment I met you, all
			those years ago, a day hasn't gone
			by when I haven't thought of you.
			And now that I'm close to you again,
			I'm in agony. The closer I get to
			you, the worse it gets. The
			thought of not being with you
			mskes my stomach turn over - my
			mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I
			can't breathe. I'm haunted by the
			kiss you should never have given
			me. My heart is beating, hoping
			that kiss will not become a scar.
			You are in my very soul,
			tormenting me. What can I do? I
			will do anything you ask...
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			If you are suffering as much as I
			am, tell me.
E
				PADME
			...I can't. We can't. It's just
			not possible.
E
				ANAKIN
			Anything's possible. Padme,
			please listen...
E
				PADME
			You listen. We live in a real
			world. Come back to it. You're
			studying to become a Jedi Knight.
			I'm a Senator. If you follow your
			thoughts through to conclusion,
			they will take us to a place we
			cannot go... regardless of the way
			we feel about each other.
E
				ANAKIN
			Then you do feel something!
			There's an extraordinary
			connection between us. You can't
			deny that.
E
				PADME
			Annie, it doesn't make any
			difference. Jedi aren't allowed
			to marry. You swore an oath,
			remember? You'd be expelled from
			the Order. I will not let you
			give up your responsibilities...
			your future, for me.
E
				ANAKIN
			I was destined to be a Jedi. I
			don't think I could be anything
			else. But you are asking me to be
			rational. That is something I
			know I cannot do. I wish I could
			wish my feelings away... but I
			can't.
E
				PADME
			I am not going to give into this.
			I'm not going to throw my life
			away. I have more important things
			to do than fall in love.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			It wouldn't have to be that way...
			we could keep it a secret.
E
				PADME
			Then we'd be living a lie - one we
			couldn't keep even if we wanted
			to. Mt sister saw it. So did my
			mother. I couldn't do that.
			Could you, Anakin? Could you live
			like that?
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			...No, you're right. It would
			destroy us.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				TAUN WE
			Welcome to Tipoca City, Master
			Jedi.
E
E
E
				TAUN WE
			Everything is ready. The Prime
			Minister expects you.
E
				OBI-WAN
				(warily)
			I'm expected?
E
				TAUN WE
			Of course! He is anxious to see
			you. After all these years, we
			were beginning to think you
			weren't coming. Now please, this
			way!
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				TAUN WE
			May I present Lama Su, Prime
			Minister of Kamino... and this is
			Master Jedi...
E
				OBI-WAN
			Obi-Wan Kenobi.
E
				LAMA SU
			Please...
E
E
E
				LAMA SU
			I trust you are going to enjoy
			your stay. We are most happy you
			have arrived at the best part of
			the season.
E
				OBI-WAN
			You make me feel most welcome.
E
				LAMA SU
			And now to business. You will be
			delighted to hear we are on
			schedule. Two hundred thousand
			units are ready, with another
			million well on the way.
E
				OBI-WAN
				(improvising)
			That is... good news.
E
				LAMA SU
			Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas
			that we have every confidence his
			order will be met on time and in
			full. He is well, I hope?
E
				OBI-WAN
			I'm sorry Master - ?
E
				LAMA SU
			Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's still
			a leading member of the Jedi
			Council, is he not?
E
				OBI-WAN
			Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas.
E
				LAMA SU
				(rising)
			You must be anxious to inspect the
			units for yourself.
E
				OBI-WAN
			That's why I'm here.
E
E
E
E
E
E
				PADM
			I don't know...
E
				ANAKIN
			Sure you do... you just don't want
			to tell me.
E
				PADM
			Are you going to use one of your
			Jedi mind tricks on me?
E
				ANAKIN
			They only work on the weak-minded.
			You are anything but weak-minded.
E
				PADM
			All right... his name was Palo.
			I was twelve. We were both in the
			Legislative Youth Program. He was
			a few years older then I... very
			cute... dark curly hair... dreamy
			eyes.
E
				ANAKIN
			All right, I get the picture...
			whatever happened to him?
E
				PADM
			I went on to become a Queen. He
			went on to become an artist.
E
				ANAKIN
			Maybe he was the smart one.
E
				PADME
			You really don't like politicians,
			do you?
E
				ANAKIN
			I like two or three, but I'm not
			really sure about one of them.
				(smiling)
			I don't think the system works.
E
				PADME
			How would you have it work?
E
				ANAKIN
			We need a system where the
			politicians sit down and discuss
			the problems, agree what's in the
			best interests of all the people,
			and then do it.
E
				PADME
			That is exactly what we do. The
			trouble is that people don't
			wlways agree. In fact, they
			hardly ever do.
E
				ANAKIN
			Then they should be made to.
E
				PADME
			By whom? Who's going to make them?
E
				ANAKIN
			I don't know. Someone.
E
				PADME
			You?
E
				ANAKIN
			Of course not me.
E
				PADME
			But someone.
E
				ANAKIN
			Someone wise.
E
				PADME
			That sounds an awful lot like a
			dictatorship to me.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			Well, if it works...
E
E
E
				PADM
			You're making fun of me.
E
				ANAKIN
			 	(sarcastic)
			On no, I'd be much too frightened
			to tease a Senator.
E
				PADM
			You're so bad!
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			You're always so serious. Always
			carrying the weight of the
			universe on your shoulders.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				LAMA SU
				(beaming)
			Magnificent, aren't they?
E
E
E
E
E
E
				LAMA SU
			We modified their genetic
			structure to make them less
			independent than the original
			host. As a result they are
			totally obedient, taking any order
			without question.
E
				OBI-WAM
			Who was the original host?
E
				LAMA SU
			A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.
			We felt a Jedi would be the
			perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand-
			picked Jango Fett himself.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Where is this bounty hunter now?
E
				LAMA SU
			Oh, we keep him here. After a few
			hundred thousand clones, the
			genetic pattern starts to fade, so
			we take a fresh supply. He lives
			here, but he's free to come and go
			as he pleases.
E
E
E
E
				LAMA SU
			Apart from his pay, which is
			considerable, Fett demanded only
			one thing - an unaltered clone for
			himself. Curious isn't it?
E
				OBI-WAN
			Unaltered?
E
				LAMA SU
			Pure genetic replication. No
			tampering with the structure to
			make it more docile... and no
			growth acceleration...
E
				OBI-WAN
			I would like to meet this Jango
			Fett.
E
				TAUN WE
			I would be most happy to arrange
			it, for you.
E
E
E
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			You mentioned growth
			acceleration...
E
				LAMA SU
			Oh yes, it's essential.
			Otherwise, a mature clone would
			take a lifetime to grow. Now, we
			can do it in half the time. Those
			items you saw on the parade ground
			were started ten years ago, when
			Sido-dyas first placed the order,
			and they're already mature...
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			And these?
E
				LAMA SU
			About five years ago.
E
E
E
E
				LAMA SU
			They're immensely superior to
			droids, capable of independent
			thought and action.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Very impressive.
E
				LAMA SU
			I'd hoped you would be pleased. 
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
				(carefully)
			Tell me, prime minister, when my
			Master Sido-dyas first contacted
			you, did he say the order was
			for... himself... or?
E
				LAMA SU
			Himself? Of course not. This
			army is for the Republic?
E
				OBI-WAN
				(astonished)
			The Repubic?
E
				LAMA SU
			We are also very much agasint this
			Count Dooku and his seccessionist
			movement. We are proud to be of
			help to the Republic.
E
E
E
E
				TAUN WE
			I have arranged for you to meet
			Jango Fett in the morning. Sleep
			well.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			Arfour, Arfour...
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			Arfour, relay this, "scramble code
			five," to Courscant: care of "the
			old folks home."
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			...I've never heard of a Jedi
			called Sido-Dyas, have you, Master?
E
				MACE WINDU
			No. Whoever placed that order was
			not a Jedi, I can assure you.
E
				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			I have a strong feeling that this
			bounty hunter is the assassin
			we're looking for.
E
				YODA
			Who he is working for... discover
			that, you must.
E
				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			I will, Master, and I will also
			find out more about this clone
			army... May The Force...
E
E
E
				WINDU 
			A clone army! Ordered by someone
			in the Senate perhaps... Someone's
			out to start a war.
E
				YODA
			Inform the chancellor of this, we
			must.
E
				WINDU
			Who do you think this impostor
			Sido-Dyas, could be?
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			No...No...No...Mom!...Don't,
			no, don't!
E
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
				(eyes closed)
			Don't go.
E
				PAMDE
			I don't want to disturb you.
E
				ANAKIN
			Your presence is soothing.
E
E
E
				PADME
			You had a nightmare again last
			night.
E
				ANAKIN
			Jedi don't have nightmares.
E
				PADME
			I heard you.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			I saw my mother. I saw her as
			clearly as I see you now. She's
			suffering, Padme. She is in
			pain...They're killing her!
				(getting up)
			I know I'm disobeying my mandate
			to protect you, Senator. I know I
			will be punished and possibly
			thrown out of the Jedi Order, but
			I must go. I have to help her!
			I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a
			choice.
E
				PADME
			Annie, I told you I wouldn't let
			you give up your future for me.
			I'll go with you. That way you
			can continue to protect me, and
			you won't be disobeying your
			mandate.
E
				ANAKIN
			What about Master Obi-wan?
E
E
E
				PADME
			I guess we won't tell him, will we?
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E

			Boba, is your father here?
E
E

			May we see him?
E

			Sure.
E
E
E
E
E
E
				BOBA FETT
			Dad! Taun We's here!
E
E
E
				TAUN WE
			Welcome back, Jango. Was your
			trip productive?
E
				JANGO FETT
			Fairly.
E
E
E
				TAUN WE
			This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan
			Kenobi. He's come to check on our
			progress.
E
				JANGO FETT
			That right?
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			Your clones are very impressive.
			You must be very proud.
E
				JANGO FETT
			I'm just a simple man, trying to
			make my way in the universe,
			Master Jedi.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Aren't we all?
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Ever made your way as far into the
			interior as Coruscant?
E
				JANGO
			Once or twice.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Recently?
E
				JANGO
				(eyes Obi-Wan carefully)
			Possibly...
E
				OBI-WAN
			Then you must know Master Sido-
			Dyas?
E
				JANGO
			Boba, close the door.
E
E
E
				JANGO
				(continuing)
			Master who?
E
				OBI-WAN
			Sido-Dyas. Isnt he the Jedi who
			hired you for this job?
E
				JANGO
			Never heard of him. I was
			recuited by a man called Darth
			Tyranus on one of the moons of
			Bogden.
E
				OBI-WAN
			No? I thought...
E
				TAUN WE
			Sido-Dyas told us to expect him.
			And he showed up just when your
			Jedi Master said he would. We
			have kept the Jedis involvement
			a secret until your arrival, just
			as your Master requested.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Curious...
E
				JANGO
			Do you like your army?
E
				OBI-WAN
			It seems to me it's your army -
			being that they are all clones of
			you.
E
				JANGO
				(grinning)
			They'll do their job well, I'll
			guarantee that.
E
				OBI-WAN
			I look forward to seeing them in
			action. Thank you for your time,
			Jango.
E
				JANGO
			Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.
E
E
E
				BOBA
			What is it, Dad?

E
E
E

				(to the droid driver)
			Wait, please.
E

				(yelling, in Huttese)
			No, not that one - that one!
E
				ANAKIN
				(arriving)
			Excuse me, Watto.
E
				WATTO
				(in Huttese)
			What?
E
				ANAKIN
				(in Huttese)
			I said excuse me.
E
E
E
				WATTO
				(in Huttese)
			Shut down.
E
E
E
				WATTO
				(continuing, in Huttese)
			What? I don't know you... What can
			I do for you? You look like a
			Jedi. Whatever it is... I didn't
			do it.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			Let me help you with that.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.
E
E
E

			Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!!
E

				(continuing; in English)
			You are Annie! It is you! You

			you couldda help wit some

E
				ANAKIN
			My mother...
E
				WATTO
			Oh, yeah. Shmi... she's not mine
			no more. I sold her.
E
				ANAKIN
			Sold her...
E
				WATTO
			Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you
			know, business is business.
			Sold her to a moisture farmer
			named Lars. Least I think it was
			Lars. Believe it or not, I heard
			he freed her and married her. Can
			ya beat that?
E
				ANAKIN
			Do you know where they are?
E
				WATTO
			Long way from here... someplace
			over on the other side of Mos
			Eisley, I think...
E
				ANAKIN
			I'd like to know.
E
E
E
				WATTO
			Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let's
			go look in my records.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				LAMA SU
			Tell your Council the first
			battalions are ready. And remind
			them that if they need more
			troops, we will need time to grow
			them.

			Threepio, what's happened?
E
				C-3PO
			I think we'd better go inside.
E
E
E
E
				C-3PO
			Master Lars - Master Owen!
			Somebody to see you!
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here
			looking for my mother.
E
				OWEN
			Owen Lars... I guess I'm your
			step-brother.
				(they shake hands)
			This is my girlfriend, Beru.
E
				BERU
			Hello.
E
				PADME
			I'm Padme.
E
				OWEN
			I had a feeling you might show up
			some day.
E
				ANAKIN
			Is my mother here?
E
				CLIEGG
			No, she's not.
E
E
E
				CLIEGG
				(continuing)
			Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife...
			Come on inside. We have a lot to
			talk about.
E
E
E
E
				CLIEGG (O.S.)
			It was just before dawn. They
			came out of nowhere. A hunting
			party of Tusekn Raiders.
E
E
E
E
				CLIEGG
			Your mother had gone out early,
			like she always did, to pick
			mushrooms that grow on the
			vaporatos. From the tracks, she
			was about halfway when they
			took her. Those Tuskens walk like
			men, but they're vicious, mindless
			monsters. Thirty of us went out
			after her. Four of us came back.
			Three more are still out there
			looking. I'd be with them,
			only... I just couldn't ride any
			more... until I heal.
E
E
E
				CLIEGG
				(continuing)
			This isn't the way I wanted to
			meet you, son. This isn't how
			your mother and I planned it. I
			don't want to give up on her, but
			she's been gone a month. There's
			little hope she's lasted this long.
E
E
E
				OWEN
			Where are you going?
E
				ANAKIN
			To find my mother.
E
				PADME
			No, Annie!
E
				CLIEGG
			She's daed, son. Accept it.
E
				ANAKIN
			I can feel her pain, and I will
			find her. I know she's alive.
E
E
E
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			You are going to have to stay
			here. These are good people,
			Padme. You'll be safe.
E
				OWEN
			Take my speeder bike.
E
				PADME
			Anakin...
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			I trust you'll watch over her,
			Owen.
E
				OWEN
			Don't worry.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			I won't be long.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				JANGO FETT
			Nearly there, son.
E
E
E
				BOBA FETT
			Dad, look!!
E
E
E
				JANGO FETT
			Hang on!
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				BOBA FETT
			Dad! Watch out!
E
				JANGO FETT
			Stay calm, son. We'll be fine.
			That Jedi won't be able to follow
			us through this.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				BOBA FETT
			Got him! Yeahhhhh!
E
				JANGO FETT
			We won't see him again.
E
E
E

E
E
E
E
E
E
				C-3PO
			Please don't leave us, Miss Padme.
			These people need your help.
E
E
E
				PADME
			I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just
			can't sleep.
E
				C-3PO
			That's something I cannot relate
			to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm
			either active or inactive.
			There's no in-between.
E
				PADME
			I guess you're lucky.
E
				C-3PO
			Do you really think so..? I
			suppose I shouldn't expect...
E
				PADME
			You're not happy here?
E
				C-3PO
			Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my
			masters here ar so kind I
			wouldn't wish to trouuble them,
			it's just... being like this...
			well, it's embarrassing.
E
				PADME
			Being like what?
E
				C-3PO
			Naked. If you pardon the
			expression. You see, when Master
			Annie made me, he never quite
			found the time to give me any
			outer covering. It's so
			humiliating. How would you like it
			if you had to go around with all
			your circuits showing?
E
				PADME
			I guess I wouldn't like it at all.
E
				C-3PO
			Of course you wouldn't. Nobody
			would. It's simply not protocol.
E
E
E
				PADME
			Maybe we can do something about it.
E
				C-3PO
			I don't think so. Only Master
			Annie...
E
				PADME
			Why not? They seem to have a box
			of old coverings here.
E
				C-3PO
			Oh? How observant of you, Miss
			Padme. Of course, I'm just not
			mechanically minded... if you see
			what I mean.
E
E
E
				PADME
			Let's see, if we put this...
			here...
E
				C-3PO
			Ooooh! That's tickles.
E
				PADME
			You'll have to be quiet, Threepio.
			Hold still, please.

				OBI-WAN
			"Guiding light" to "old folks
			home."
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			...Starships from the Trade
			Federation and the Commerce Guilds
			are taking deliveries of battle
			droids from the foundries on
			Geonosis.
E
				BAIL ORGANA
			That's outrageous! The treaty
			forbids the Trade Federation from
			building up an army. What are
			they doing?!
E
				OBI-WAN
			The droid foundry seems to be
			working at full capacity. I am
			going to go down and investigate.
			I will bring Jango Fett back home
			for interrogation.
E
				PALPATINE
			Those Geonosian foundries are part
			of the Techno Union. We will call
			in their representatives and ask
			them a few very pointed questions.
E
				OBI-WAN
			One more thing. Jango mentioned
			he was recruited by someone named
			Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that
			might be?
E
				YODA
			With the forename Darth, a Sith he
			must be.
E
				MACE WINDU
			Our missing apprentice. They are
			playing their hand at last.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Do you believe he could be the
			mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the
			deal for the clone army?
E
				YODA
			Perhaps too many pieces are missing
			from this puzzle, there are.
E
				MACE WINDU
			Be careful, Obi-Wan. This
			investigation is becoming less
			than routine. Do you need help?
E
				OBI-WAN
			Let me see if I can figure out
			what's going on first.
E
E
E
				BAIL ORGANA
			The Commerce Guilds are preparing
			for war... there can be no doubt
			of that.
E
				PALPATINE
			Count Dooku must have made a
			treaty with them.
E
				MACE WINDU
			We must stop them soon before
			they're fully ready.
E
				SENATOR ASK AAK
			The debate is over, we need
			that clone army now!
E
				BAIL ORGANA
			Unfortunately, the debate is not
			over. The Senate will never be
			able to approve the use of that
			army before the separatists
			attack.
E
E
E
				MAS AMEDDA
			This is a crisis! If the Senate
			votes the Chancellor emergency
			powers, he could approve the use
			of the army in a minute.
E
				PALPATINE
			Please, please, I don't wish to
			have emergency powers. That's too
			extreme a solution. It's akin to
			a dictatorship. We must rely on
			the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many
			are available to go to Geonosis?
E
E
E
				YODA
			Two Hundred,... less or more.
E
				BAIL ORGANA
			With all due respect for the Jedi
			Order, two hundred will be no
			match for hundreds of thousands of
			battle droids.
E
				MACE WINDU
			Patience. We should wait for Obi-
			Wan to report back. We don't know
			that Count Dooku has made a treaty
			with the Corporate Alliance, it's
			speculation.
E
				SENATOR ASK AAK
			But we must prepare for the worst.
			I'm going to propose a motion
			granting emergency powers to the
			Chancellor at the next session. We
			must not wait!
E
				PALPATINE
			Out of the question, Senator! You
			and I are too closely aligned.
			The issue will become partisan and
			debates will begin. The proposal
			must come from a neutral source.
E
				MAS AMEDDA
			If only Senator Amidala were here.
E
E
E
				JAR JAR
			Supreme Chancellor... my august
			colleagues, I would be proud to
			propose the motion in question.
			This is a grave situation, and I'm
			sure Senator Amidala, and the
			Queen of Naboo would agree.
E
				SENATOR ASK AAK
			Thank you, Representative Binks.
E
E
E
				PALPATINE
			If called upon, I will serve. But
			it will be the saddest day of my
			life.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				PADME
			There!
E
E
E
				C-3PO
			Um. How do I look?
E
				OWEN
			Great! You look perfect.
E
				C-3PO
			Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm so
			happy!
				(extending his hand to shake hers)
			Oh, pardon me.
E
E

				(continuing)
			Thank you.

			Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

			Well, Padme, I think he should be

			Oh, my!

			...Alliance have pledged their

			forming an... Wait!... ah...
			attack... I don't... make it...
			aaaggghhh!
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			I'm going after him!
E
				PADME
			I thought the first thing he said
			was to retransmit his message to
			Coruscant.
E
				ANAKIN
			Yeah, you're right, you're right.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				MACE WINDU
			We will deal with Count Dooku. The
			most important thing for you,
			Anakin, is to stay where you are.
			Protect the Senator at all costs.
			That is your priority.
E
				ANAKIN
			Understood, Master.
E
E
E
				PADME
			They'll never get there in time to
			save him. They have to come half
			way across the galaxy. Look,
			Geonosis is less than a parsec away.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			If he's still alive.
E
				PADME
			Annie, are you just going to sit
			here and let him die?? He's your
			friend... your mentor...
E
				ANAKIN
			...He's like my father, but you
			heard Master Windu. He gave me
			strict orders to stay here.
E
				PADME
			He gave you strict orders to
			protect me...
E
E
E
				PADME
				(continuing)
			...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan.
			So if you plan to protect me, you
			will have to come along.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				MACE WINDU
			The longer we wait, the stronger
			Dooku's armies become. We cannot
			wait for the Senate to make up its
			mind about granting the Chancellor
			emergency powers, in order to be
			able to use that clone army... We
			have the authority to go now. We
			must go now.
E
E
E
				YODA
			Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred
			Jedi send. Enough, let's hope
			they are.
E
E
E
E
				MAS AMEDDA
			Order! Order!!
E
E
E
				PALPATINE
			In the regrettable absence of
			Senator Amidala, the chair
			recognises Senior
			Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar
			Binks.
E
E
E
				JAR JAR
			Senators, dellow felagates...
E
E
E
				MAS AMEDDA
			Order! The Senate will accord the
			Representative the courtesy of a
			hearing!
E
E
E
				JAR JAR
			In response to the direct threat
			to the Republic from the
			Confederacy of Independent
			Systems, I propose that the Senate
			gives immediate emergency powers to
			the Supreme Chancellor.
E
E
E
				JAR JAR
				(continuing)
			Who can deny these are exceptional
			times? Exceptional times demand
			exceptional measures!
			Exceptional measures demand
			exceptional men!
E
				ORN FREE TAA
			We won't support a dictator.
E
E
E
				JAR JAR
			That is the sentiment every one of
			us agrees with! And when the
			shadow of war has dispersed and
			the bright day of liberty has
			dawned once again, the power we now
			give to the Supreme Chancellor
			will be gladly, and swiftly
			returned. Out ancient liberties
			will be restored to us, burnished
			even more brightly than before!
E
E
E
E
E
				PALPATINE
			It is with great reluctance that
			I have agreed to this calling. I
			love democracy... I love the
			Republic. The fact that this
			crisis is demanding I be given
			absolute power to tule over you is
			evident. But I am mild by nature
			and have no desire to destroy
			the democratic process. The power you
			give me I will lay down when this
			crisis has abated, I promise you.
			And all I ask in return is when my
			current term of office is over,
			you allow me to reture and live
			out my life in peace.
E
				MAS AMEDDA
			We shall proceed to the vote. All
			those in favor of granting
			emergency powers to the Supreme
			Chancellor, signal ate at this
			time... those opposed?
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			Hey, where are you going?
E
				PADME
			To find Obi-Wan.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			No! You're not!
E
E
E
				PADME
			Let go of me!
E
				ANAKIN
			I'm not letting you go out there.
			It's too dangerous.
E
				PADM
			What?!?
E
				ANAKIN
			It's my job to protect you. I said
			it's too dangerous. You're not
			going, and that's final!
E
				PADM
			Don't you give me orders, Annie!
			I'm a Senator of the Galactic
			Republic. You have no authority
			to contain me, restrain me, or
			direct me! You remember your
			place, young man.
				(standing up)
			Now you can come along and protect
			me or stay here. It's up to you.
E
E
E
E
E
				C-3PO
			Yes, it is, Artoo. Most
			confusing. One moment they're
			generating a pleasant mutual
			attraction and the next, waves of
			violent hostility. Even though
			I'm programmed to understand them,
			I doubt if I ever shall.
E
E
E
E
E
E
				PADME
				(in a low voice)
			It's empty!
E
E
E
E
E
E
				PADME
			Wait!
E
E
E
E
E
				COUNT DOOKU
			Senator Amidala, I've heard so
			much about you.
E
				PADM
			Count Dooku, I assume.
E
				COUNT DOOKU
			I'm delighted to meet you at
			last. We have a great deal to
			discuss, Senator. I hope you can
			keep your young Jedi under control.
E
				PADM
			Don't worry he's housebroken.
E
E
E
E
E
				PADM
			You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi-
			Wan Kenobi. I am formally
			requesting you turn him over to
			me, now.
E
				DOOKU
			He has been convicted of
			espionage, Senator, and will be
			executed. In just a few hours, I
			believe.
E
E
E
				PADM
			He is an officer of the Republic.
			You can't do that.
E
				DOOKU
			We don't recognise the Republic
			here, Senator. But if Naboo were
			to join our Alliance, I could
			easily hear your plea for clemency.
E
E
E
				PADM
			And if I don't join your
			rebellion, I assume this Jedi with
			me will also die?
E
				DOOKU
			I don't wish to make you to join
			our cause against your will,
			Senator, but you are a rational,
			honest representative of your
			people and I assume you want to do
			what's in their best interest.
			Aren't you fed up with the
			corruption, the bureaucrats, the
			hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't
			you? Be honest, Senator.
E
				PADM
			The ideals are still alive, Count,
			even if the institution is failing.
E
				DOOKU
			You believe in the same ideals we
			believe in! The same ideals we
			are striving to make prominent.
E
				PADM
			If what you say is true, you
			should stay in the Republic and
			help Chancellor Palpatine put
			things right.
E
				DOOKU
			The Chancellor means well, M'Lady
			but he is incompetent. He has
			promised to cut the bureaucracy,
			but the bureaucrats are stronger
			than ever, no? Senator, the
			Republic cannot be fixed. It is
			time to start over. The
			democratic process in the Republic
			is a sham, a shell game played
			on the voters. It will not be long
			before the cult of greed, called
			the Republic, will lose even the
			pretext of democracy and freedom.
E
				PADM
			I cannot believe that. I will not
			forsake all I have honoured and
			worked for and betray the
			Republic. I know of your treaties
			with the Trade Federation, the
			Commerce Guilds, and the others,
			Count. What is happening here is
			not government that has been
			bought out by business... it's
			business becoming government!
E
				DOOKU
			Are you willing to betray your Jedi
			friends? Without your co-operation
			I can do nothing to stop their
			execution.
E
				PADM
			What is to happen to me? Am I to be
			executed also?
E
				DOOKU
			I wouldn't think of such an
			offence. But, there are
			individuals who have a strong
			interest in your demise, M'lady.
			It has nothing to do with
			politics, I'm afraid. It's purely
			personal, and they have already
			paid great sums to have you
			assassinated. I'm sure they will
			push hard to have you included in
			the executions. I'm sorry but if
			you are not going to co-operate, I
			must turn you over to the
			Geonosians for justice. I've done
			all I can for you.
E
E
E
				JANGO FETT
			I'll take that weapon.
E
E
E
				DOOKU 
			You may cause a lot of bloodshed,
			my young Jedi, but you will not
			escape.
E
				PADM
			Anakin...
E
E
E
E
E
E
				SUN RIT
			You have been charged and found
			guilty of Espionage.
E
				POGGLE
			Do you have anything to say before
			your sentence is carried out?
E
				PADM
			You are committing an act of war,
			Archduke. I hope you are prepared
			for the consequences.
E
E
E
				POGGLE
			We build weapons, Senator... that
			is our business! Of course we're
			prepared!
E
				NUTE GUNRAY
			Get on with it. Carry out the
			sentence. I want to see her suffer.
E
				POGGLE
			Your other Jedi friend is waiting
			for you, Senator. Take them to
			the arena!
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			Don't be afraid.
E
				PADM
			I'm not afraid to die. I've been
			dying a little bit each day since
			you came back into my life.
E
				ANAKIN
			What are you talking about?
E
				PADM
			I love you.
E
				ANAKIN
			You love me?! I thought we
			decided not to fall in love. That
			we would be forced to live a lie.
			That it would destroy our lives...
E
				PADM
			I think our lives are about to be
			destroyed anyway. My love for you
			is a puzzle, Annie, for which I
			have no answers. I can't control
			it... and now I don't care. I
			truly, deeply love you, and before
			we die I want you to know.
E
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			I have no desire to be cured of
			this love either. Long or short,
			I vow to spend the rest of my life
			with you.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			I was beginning to wonder if you
			had gotten my message.
E
				ANAKIN
			I retransmitted it as you
			requested, Master. Then we decided
			to come and rescue you.
E
				OBI-WAN
			It looks like you're going a good
			job so far.
E
E
E
				SUN RIT
			The felons before you have been
			convicted of espionage against the
			Sovereign System of Geonosis.
			Their sentence of death is to be
			carried out in this public arena
			henceforth.
E
E
E

			Let the executions begin!
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			I have a bad feeling about this.
E
E

				OBI-WAN
			Take the one the left. I'll
			take the one on the right.
E

			What about Padme?
E

			It looks like she's already on top
			of things.

				(nods, gasping)
			Sure! Well, sort of.
E
				ANAKIN
			Jump!!!
E

			This isn't how it's supposed to
			be! Jango, finish her off.
E
E
E

				(smiling enigmatically)
			Patiece, Viceroy... she will die.
			Maybe this is the way it's

			Yes, it has been rather a long

			happened to them?
E
E
E

			Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't think
			so. It looks a very dull planet
			to me. They should be back
			shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo.
E
E
E
E
				COUNT DOOKU
			Master Windu, how pleasant of you
			to join us. You're just in time
			for the moment of truth. I would
			think these two new boys of yours
			could use a little more training.
E
				MACE WINDU
			Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku.
			This party's over.
E
E
E
				COUNT DOOKU
				(to Mace Windu)
			Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi
			friend. You're impossibly
			outnumbered.
E
				MACE WINDU
			I don't think so. One Jedi has to
			be worth a hundred Geonosians.
E
E
E
				COUNT DOOKU
			It wasn't the Geonosians I was
			thinking about. How well do you
			think one Jedi will hold up
			against a thousand battle droids?
E

			Don't worry! It's being - taken

			We've done it! Now we have a

			The system's off but they're still
			active. That's a new feature. They
			are independent of the control

E
E
				COUNT DOOKU
			Master Windu!
E
E
E
				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			You have fought gallantly. Worthy
			of recognition in the history
			archives of the Jedi Order. Now
			it is finished.
				(pauses briefly)
			Surrender - and your lives will be 
			spared.
E
				MACE WINDU
			We will not be hostages for you to
			barter with Dooku.
E
				COUNT DOOKU
			Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You
			will have to be destroyed.
E
E
E
				PADME
			Look!
E
E
E
				YODA
			Come on - hurry! Hurry!
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				YODA
			More battalions to the left.
			Encircle them we must, then
			divide.
E
E
E
E
E
E
				C-3PO
			I'm sure I heard something, this
			time. Didn't you? It's probably
			just a celebration
E
E
E
E
E
E

E
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
			Hold on! Look over there...
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			It's Dooku, go after him!
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Padme!!!
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
				(continuing; to pilot)
			Put the ship down! Down!
E
				OBI-WAN
			No! Forget her. We have to go
			after Dooku.
E
				ANAKIN
			No we're not!! Land this ship!
E
				OBI-WAN
			Don't let your personal feelings
			get in the way. We've got a job to
			do.
E
E
E
				ANAKIN
			I don't care!.. Go back.
E
				OBI-WAN
			Anakin! She's all right! Look.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Follow that speeder!
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				DROID CAPTAIN
			Your Excellency!
E
E
E
				COUNT DOOKU
			That won't be necessary, Captain.
			Stand down. And leave them to me.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
				(to Anakin)
			We move in together - you slowly
			on the...
E
				ANAKIN
			I'm taking him now!
E
				OBI-WAN
			Anakin, no!
E
				ANAKIN
			You'll pay for all the Jedi you've
			killed today, Dooku.
E
E
E
				COUNT DOOKU
			Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see,
			my Jedi powers are far beyond
			yours. Now, back down.
E
				OBI-WAN
			I don't think so.
E
E
E
				COUNT DOOKU
			Ah, but if I must.
E
E
E
				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			I have spent the last ten years
			learning to use the power of the
			Dark Side. It gives me infinitely
			greater power.
E
				OBI-WAN
			You will have to prove it.
E
E
E
				COUNT DOOKU
			Grand Master Kenobi, you
			disappoint me. Yoda holds you in
			such high esteem.
E
E
E
				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			Surely you can do better...?
				(parries)
			No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi
			swordsmanship degenerated so
			quickly, or are you trying to make
			fun of me?
				(cuts)
			Which is it?
E
E
E
				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me
			out of my misery.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			That's brave of you, boy - but
			foolish. I would have thought
			you'd have learnt your lesson.
E
				ANAKIN
			I'm a slow learner.
E
E
E
				COUNT DOOKU
			You have unusual powers, young
			Padawan. But not enought to save
			you this time.
E
				ANAKIN
			Don't bet on it!
E
				OBI-WAN
			Anakin!
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				COUNT DOOKU
			Master Yoda. At last we shall
			know who is the most powerful.
E
E
E
				YODA
			Count Dooku. No interest in
			contests, do I have.
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				YODA
				(continuing)
			The end for you, Count, this is.
E
				COUNT DOOKU
			...Not yet...
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				PADM
			Anakin!
E
E
E
				CLONE CAPTAIN
			Resistance is at an end, General.
			What are your orders ?
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
E
				COUNT DOOKU
			The Force is with us, my Master.
E
				DARTH SIDIOUS
			Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have
			done well.
E
				COUNT DOOKU
			I bring you good news, my Lord.
			The war has begun.
E
				DARTH SIDIOUS
			Excellent. 
			 	(smiling)
			Everything is going as planned.
E
E
E
E
E
E
				MACE WINDU
			Where is your apprentice?
E
				OBI-WAN
			On his way back to Naboo. He is
			escorting Senator Amidala home.
E
E
E
				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			I must admit without the clones,
			it would not have been a victory.
E
				YODA
			Victory? Victory, you say?
E
E
E
				YODA
				(continuing)
			Not victory, a defeat, it was...
			Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone
			War has!
